DESCRIPTION
Vim can reformat lines with the gq command, according to 'textwidth' and
'formatoptions', which is very handy. But sometimes you want to format to a
different width, or just a single block in a vertical column layout. That
requires a temporary :setlocal tw=N, and copying the block elsewhere to
reformat it, which is cumbersome.

This plugin provides a visual mode <Leader>gq command that reformats only the
selection; how exactly depends on the selection mode. The new width is
determined by a passed [count], or the width of the selection's first line.
With this, you can easily reformat lines to a certain width, or a blockwise
selection while leaving the text to the left and right alone.

USAGE
{Visual}<Leader>gq      Linewise selection: Format the selected text to the
                        width of the first selected line / to [count]
                        characters.
                        Blockwise selection: Format the selected text to the
                        width of the block / to [count] characters, and
                        change the selected text in-place. If the reformatted
                        text consists of less lines, the remainder of the
                        block will consist of spaces. If it's more lines,
                        these will be inserted as additional lines,
                        left-aligned with spaces to the start column of the
                        block.
                        Characterwise selection: Format the selected text to
                        the width of the first selected line / to [count]
                        characters, and align all following lines to the start
                        column of the selection.

EXAMPLE LINEWISE
To re-wrap the following text:
    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
to a 'textwidth' of 20, you select the entire line, then reformat to the
specified width: V20<Leader>gq
    The quick brown fox
    jumps over the lazy
    dog.

EXAMPLE BLOCKWISE
You have a multi-column layout like this:
    Intro | The quick brown fox       -
          | jumps over the lazy dog.  - (he's very lazy)
Let's reformat the middle column to use all the available space.
You select the entire column as a block, e.g. with f|l<C-V>t-j, then reformat
the selection with <Leader>gq:
    Intro | The quick brown fox jumps -
          | over the lazy dog.        - (he's very lazy)
Okay, but now you want it wider: gv40<Leader>gq reformats to a 40-char column:
    Intro | The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy -
          | dog.                                    - (he's very lazy)
